= Living Documentation Workshop
=======================

== Goal

Learn ways of creating living documentation. +
Be able to publish this documentation for everyone's eyes.

== Pretext exercice

We'll use the Parrot kata as a pretext to try and learn living documentation.

=== Script

Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful you can make it.

=== Acknowledgements

This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring". It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already I suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
